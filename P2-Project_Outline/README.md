## Submission Instructions

### Overview

During the Covid-19 pandemic, many schools have closed and parents are tasked with homeschooling their children.  There's alot to keep organized, especially if you have multiple children.  There are the actual assignments, either online or sent home from school, mulitiple logins for learning sites and school sites, upcoming events/appointments (assignment packet pick-ups, school events, start dates, phone appointments) and the multiple teacher contacts per student.  I have at least 4 teachers/OT/speech therapists per kid that contact me weekly by email, and it can be difficult to remember who's who. 

It would be great to give parents a singular place to organize all of this information. I'd like to build a site that allowed parents to organize that information by child.

User Login - Parents will be able to create user accounts
Create Child - Parents will be able to 'profiles' for each of their children

### Technologies

I'm not sure what other Technologies I'll need yet.  Will definitely be looking for ways to use something new.
